# 👋 Hi there, I’m Zhuoer Shen (Bonnie)

🎓 I'm a graduate student at **Yale University**, majoring in **Biostatistics and Data Science**, with a strong foundation in Mathematics from **Fudan University**.

💡 I’m passionate about:
- 🧠 **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and how they reason, learn, and adapt
- 📈 **Quantitative research**, especially building trading systems driven by technical and statistical signals
- 🤖 **AI applications in the real world**, from autonomous agents to data-driven decision tools

🚀 Recent projects & experiences:
- Developed a full **trend-following trading system** using Python, Pandas, and TA-Lib, including signal generation and backtesting.
- Built **tool-augmented LLM agents** using ReAct and LangChain, integrating Notion, search APIs, and vector databases.
- Led a research project on **two-stage training (SFT + DPO)** to improve LLaMA2/3's math reasoning accuracy using style-varied GSM8k data.

🌱 Currently exploring:
- 📘 **Stochastic Processes in Finance**
- 🛠️ Advanced **C++** for system-level efficiency
- 🧮 Better CoT prompting and agent architectures
